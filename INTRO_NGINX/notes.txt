-t (tty): Allocates a pseudo-TTY, which is useful for interactive processes. In this case, it's not strictly necessary since NGINX runs as a background service.

--rm: removes any stoped containers, clean up containers and remove files system

-d: stands for A daemon (sometimes spelled "demon") is a background process that runs continuously and performs tasks or services for other processes or users, often without direct user interaction. Daemons are commonly used in operating systems to handle various system functions and manage services.
